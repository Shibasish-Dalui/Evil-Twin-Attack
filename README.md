# Evil-Twin-Attack

## Introducion

An Evil Twin Attack is a type of wireless attack where a malicious actor creates a 
fake wireless access point (AP) that masquerades as a legitimate one. The goal of 
this attack is to trick users into connecting to the malicious AP instead of the 
legitimate one, allowing the attacker to intercept data or perform other malicious 
activities. This type of attack may be used to steal the passwords of unsuspecting 
users, either by monitoring their connections or by phishing, which involves setting 
up a fraudulent web site and luring people there.
