# Evil-Twin-Attack

## Abstract 
 
With the rapid expansion of digital technologies, the threat landscape facing 
organizations has become increasingly complex and dynamic. As cyberattacks 
continue to evolve in sophistication and frequency, there is a pressing need for 
proactive security measures to protect sensitive information and critical 
infrastructures. Hacking emerges as a crucial methodology in this endeavors, 
offering a structured approach to identify vulnerabilities and mitigate potential risks 
before they can be exploited by malicious actors. The Evil Twin Attack is a 
sophisticated form of wireless network deception, often employed in malicious 
contexts, where an attacker creates a fraudulent Wi-Fi access point (AP) that mimics 
a legitimate one.
